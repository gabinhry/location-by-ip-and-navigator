This module will allow you to locate your user by navigator permission, or by IP address.

To make this module work, a 13€/month subscription to `ip-api` service is needed.

In this module you'll have :
- Navigator permission ask
- Navigator coordinate ask
- IP get by the nest backend
- Calls to a service api-ip.com to get the location of the IP

You can use this module to learn how to locate your users (with their consent!) or just to copy past it in your project to get something working directly. ¯&#92;&#95;(ツ)&#95;/¯
